## Loch Ness
### I didn't see the Loch Ness Monster, but the scenery by the lake was nice.

### I spent the entire day before I leave by sit near the Loch and surprise the fog is come, which make the Loch Ness another view.

## Urquhart Castle
### A very old castle on the shores of Loch Ness. Urquhart Castle was built between the 13th and 16th centuries and was abandoned after the 17th century.

## Other View In Highland
### A place close to the Balmacaan Deer Forest. It is a pity that I cannot enter the forest due to seasonal reasons.
