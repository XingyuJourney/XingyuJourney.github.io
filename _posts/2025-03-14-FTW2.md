## North Face Trail

### During my stay at Nevis Range Mountain Resort, I didn’t feel like renting a bike, and since it wasn’t ski season, I ended up simply wandering around the area. While exploring, I came across a small path with a signpost pointing to Fort William — and so, on a whim, I decided to start walking in that direction.

### The entire walk was originally meant to take around two hours. The scenery in the first half of the journey was already quite impressive, so I’ve included a few photos below to capture the atmosphere.

### Roughly halfway through the walk, I noticed a sign marked "The North Face". It immediately caught my attention, and I decided to change course and head towards the North Face Trail instead. That turned out to be a wise choice — the woodland along the way was beautiful and surprisingly tranquil.

### In the latter part of the trail, I finally caught sight of the dramatic North Face cliffs of Ben Nevis. The sky was moody and overcast, which gave the whole scene a unique and brooding charm.

### The final photo was taken just before the trail ended. By then, the clouds had cleared and the weather has improved.
