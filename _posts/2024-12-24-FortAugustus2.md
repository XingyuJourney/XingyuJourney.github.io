## Fort Augustus (The Actual Fort)

### On the side of the village closest to Loch Ness, there’s a distinctive hotel owned by The Highland Club — and it also happened to be where I stayed. The hotel is housed in a former 19th-century Benedictine Monastery, and staying there was a wonderful experience. Below is a view of the monastery in its entirety.

### When I checked in, the staff gave a brief introduction to its history, including the fact that the monastery was built on the grounds of Fort Augustus, an 18th-century military fortress. 

### The following photos show the cloisters and the lounge area inside the monastery. During my stay, I often found myself relaxing in the lounge — mostly because it rained every day and the Highland winter evenings turned dark quite early.

### The monastery gardens are also lovely, stretching right down to the shores of Loch Ness.
