## Fort Augustus

## This blog focuses on Fort Augustus as a village; the actual fort will be covered in the next post.

### Fort Augustus lies in the heart of the Great Glen, right at the southern end of Loch Ness. I took the photo below at the village bus stop. That petrol station in the background ended up being my main source of food during those days — it was pretty much the only shop around.

### The photo below is one of my favourites from this trip. It captures Loch Ness, which also appeared in a previous blog post, though that was a different location. What made this moment special was the mountains in the background: they turned snow-capped almost overnight, which felt quite magical.

### Both sides of the village bridge offer lovely views. The three photos below were all taken from the bridge — the first two feature buildings that are now abandoned.
