# Ben Nevis

## Conclusion: In harsh weather, it is unwise to climb the snowy mountain alone. If your equipment is inadequate and time is short, it is best to avoid the journey altogether.

## Stage zero
### At first I didn't realize the seriousness of this situation.

## Stage one
### As I started to climb, the sky in front of me turned cloudy, but it looked like good weather behind me.

## Stage two
### At this time, I had climbed halfway up the mountain. Although visibility was poor, it was not snowing.

## Stage three
### When I climbed above the snow line and entered the final stage, I encountered a blizzard. Because I didnâ€™t have basic equipment such as gloves and goggles, I felt like I was in prison from that moment on. The visibility was very low and I could only see the road under my feet.

## Leaving
### After the sun went down, I finally reached the foot of the mountain.
