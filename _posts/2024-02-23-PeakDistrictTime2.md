# Hope Valley

## Win Hill
### The name is pretty interesting.
### A tree I came across at the beginning of climb.

### The weather was not good during the climbing, even hail in the middle.

### Luckily, the sun came out after we reached the top of the hill. At this time, I can see the reservoir, bridge and Bamford Edge in the distance.

### On the way back, I saw a nice view from the train station.
